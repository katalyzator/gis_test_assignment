### Running with Docker

Declare environment variables. You can find this information in **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** section.


To declare environment variables just run following command:


```
cp .env.dev .env
```

Start services  
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Server is up and running on port 5000

### Documentation

After building go to through the link 

http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs/

And you can see documentations of project

### Running tests with Docker


```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-tests.yml up --build
```


### Running with manage.py

Start postgres  
```
docker-compose up postgres
```

Create virtual environment  
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

Activate your virtual environment  
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements  
```
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

Declare environment variables  
```
export <ENV_VAR>=<ENV_VALUE>
```

Apply new migrations if any  
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Start server  
```
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

Server is up and running on port 8000


## Basic commands

### Setting up your users

To create a superuser account, use this command:  
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Creating migrations
 
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

### Applying migrations
 
```
python manage.py migrate
```

### If you are using docker to start the server, then you need to execute these commands

```
docker exec -it test_django sh
```

inside docker terminal

```commandline
python manage.py createsuperser
```

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:
```
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage html
```
Open `htmlcov/index.html` to see output

### Running linter

```
flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake-report
```
Open `flake-report/index.html` to see linter output

### Running tests

```
python manage.py test
```
Open `test-report.xml` to see test output


## Data and Action flow

### View
This is basically a controller that invokes other components 
and does not contain any business logic inside.  
Usually it is an `APIView` that only knows about what authentication 
and permissions classes it should use.

### Service
This component is responsible for the business logic related stuff 
and contains some high-level API for the controller(view).  
Usually it is basic Python class with some `classmethods`.
If the method is/should not be used outside of the service
then make sure to mark it as private using `_` in the naming.  
You should always use [**type annotations**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) when defining these methods, 
so everyone knows how to use them.

### Serializer
This component is responsible for validating user input and serializing `querysets` into native Python data types.  
Don't use `save()` method. It will give too much responsibility to this component. The only things it should do
are defined above. 

### Model
This is basically a representation of your database table.  
Thus, it should not contain any business logic here. Sometimes it may have some calculated fields(`@property`).
